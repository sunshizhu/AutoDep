Description: # MAAS Deployer
        
        MAAS deployer provides the ability to automate the deployment of MAAS clusters
        for use as a Juju provider. Using a set of configuration files and simple
        commands this tool will build a MAAS cluster using virtual machines for the
        region controller and bootstrap hosts and automatically commission nodes as
        required so that the only next step required is to deploy services with Juju.
        
        # Installation and Usage
        
        A basic workflow starts by writing a YAML file describing the MAAS cluster you
        want to create. The examples directory contains a sample YAML that can be used
        as starting point. There are many supported options such as network
        configuration, node tagging, proxies etc.
        
        To install maas-deployer please do the following:
        
          sudo add-apt-repository ppa:maas-deployers/stable
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install maas-deployer
        
        Once you have create a yaml description of your deployment do:
        
          maas-deployer -c deployment.yaml --debug
        
        Once this has completed, you should end up with two virtual machines, one for
        the Juju bootstrap host and one for the MAAS controller whose web interface
        should be available at http://<maas-host>/MAAS.
        
        By default maas-deployer will check if any resources it wants to create already
        exist and fail if they do. You can optionally reuse existing resources to make
        runs idempotent by using the --use-existing flag or force delete resource
        before creating them using the --force flag e.g.
        
          maas-deployer -c deployment.yaml --force
        
        A successful run of MAAS deployer should give you the following:
        
          - MAAS node provisioned and configured
        
          - MAAS boot-images in progress of being downloaded
        
          - Configuration parameters configured in MAAS
        
          - Nodes commissioning in http://<maas-host>/MAAS/#/nodes
        
          - Nodes tagged appropriately (api, bootstrap, etc)
        
          - Juju environments.yaml file generated and uploaded to
            /home/juju on maas controller
        
          - Nodes commissioned and ready
        
        # Deploying charms
        
        The controller vm will have a pre-configured Juju environments file uploaded to
        /home/juju/.juju/environments.yaml which can used by logging in and switching
        to the juju user:
        
          sudo su - juju
          juju bootstrap --constraints="tags=bootstrap"
        
        Or alternatively you could just copy it over to your $HOME e.g.
        
          sudo cp -R /home/juju/.juju ~
          sudo chown -R <user>: .juju
          juju bootstrap --constraints="tags=bootstrap"
        
        Once the environment is bootstrapped you deploy charms as you like.
